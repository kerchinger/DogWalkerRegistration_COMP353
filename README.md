# COMP363_FinalProject Dog Walking App
I put a username and password for the Admin account: username: kyle password = password
Also, you can connect to the database I think it would be easiest if we all just had the same username and password, you can add a user to your database with username: dog_walk and password: walkme

So, the index.php I found a simple webpage and copied the code onto it, so the front of our webpage looks cool, let me know if you have questions I can tell you what I know.
Also, I was thinking that the home_page would just direct the person to either an Admin account or Reserving a walking spot, so that most of the requirements for the project can be placed in the reserve.php and admin.php (and elsewhere) rather than in the index.php. I hope you like the home_page and for simplicity  we can take it out if you guys want too
